# A list of errors currently found in the game

# 2018/05/09 Fixed a few bugs, found some

- After dice rolled / piece chosen, that piece should move automatically
- Don't allow multiple selection (probably remove activation indicator)
- Check for valid moves after roll, if none, turnover

# Old Bugs

- Clicking an invalid move should not end your turn. (Don't think this happens anymore)
- Token flags should be all reset at once in a single function (cleanup).
- Knockback doesn't always work
- De-select token after safe space move? (Or fix bugs)
- Join the party bug
- Win / Changeover confusion?
- Tom Scott Display required
- Lazy tokens because of knockback
